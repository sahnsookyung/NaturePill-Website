				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					When rendering the environment, we want the best possible graphics to create the highest sense of
					realism.
					It is a bit of an art balancing realism and performance,
					as they are conflicting goals and gaining on the one side results in a loss in the other.
					There is a limit to the amount of computation in terms of time that we can fit in for each frame
					rendered,
					and efficient rendering is important because it provides increased frame rates resulting in a more
					immersive experience.
				</p>

				<h2>Realism</h2>
				<p> We have used some graphical techniques
					to improve realism. Realism results in performance reduction. In
					general, the models for the forest were high quality scanned models
					and enabled us to create a realistic environment using these models.
					The texturing of the terrain was meticulously done to blend
					combinations of grass, leaves, rocks, roots, sand and soil, and debris
					placed (Figure 6) throughout the environment in convincing
					locations. The trees used were of the same species, but such forests
					are not rare in the world.</p>

				<h3>High Dynamic Range (HDR)</h3>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/HDRvsSDR.PNG" alt="" /></span>In the natural environment a
					wide range of color occurs, and
					standard dynamic range (SDR) is insufficient to create the
					sensation that a person is watching a real object. HDR increases has
					a larger range compared to SDR allowing for more realistic
					lighting through increased color gamut and contrast, resulting in
					brighter highlights, darker shadows, more details in the highlights
					and shadows. Through HDR we can create lighting
					that emulates the glare of the halo that forms around bright objects
					such as the sun. The image seen on the left has HDR
					applied on the left and SDR on the right. There is a partial
					glare of the sun that can be observed on the left side
					while there is none on the right side, and a slight color divide occurs
					at the center due to the difference of HDR and SDR.</p>
				<h3>Lights and Shadows</h3>
				<p>
					Realistic lighting and shadows are important for the environment.

					Cooler, sunny weather tends to be associated with less stress.
					The lighting of the environment was made to be quite bright and sunny,
					with a lower position of the sun in relation to the horizon to support the
					illusion of cooler weather.

					The sunlight for the environment has been rendered as a directional
					light aligned with the position of the sun in the skybox. Color
					temperature of daylight can range from 4800K to 10000K, and we
					initially used cooler light temperature of 8200K to match the cooler
					feel for the environment. Although the environment was relaxing
					according to the heuristic evaluators of the environment,
					research showed that warmer tones are better for relaxation. Therefore, we decided to decrease the
					color temperature of the sunlight to 6700K, which is a slight increase in
					color temperature compared to the average outdoor noon temperature of 6504K
					based on the D65 colorimetry standard created by the
					International Commission on Illumination. Additionally, we added a bloom
					effect to the sun to simulate its glow and add to its realism.

					We used the highest shadow resolution provided natively by Unity to minimize
					the appearance pixelated shadows, and scaled the rendering distances for shadows
					appropriately so the discontinuity in the shadows are unnoticeable to the user.
				</p>
				<h3>Antialiasing</h3>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/3x zoom AA FXAA.PNG" alt="" /></span>When rendering
					computer graphics, geometric objects are sampled
					which generate pixels that are rendered on a computer screen.
					There is a fundamental problem of this discretization process
					stemming from limited sampling rates of displays, resulting in
					objects appearing blocky, or stair-wise along its edges, silhouettes,
					or creases. Due to this effect known as aliasing, sometimes very small objects
					disappear between samples, or complex details of the features may
					be lost. To avoid aliasing, we use an antialiasing
					(AA) technique to mitigate it. There are a multitude of AA
					techniques in the realm of computer science, and we briefly investigated
					the effect of three AA techniques: MSAA (Multisampling anti-aliasing), FXAA (Fast approximate
					anti-aliasing), and
					SMAA ( Subpixel morphological anti-aliasing) in our <a
						href="resources/Soo Kyung Ahn NaturePill.pdf">paper</a>.
					The image on the left shows an image with FXAA and 3x zoom applied. Its inherent blurring of the
					scene can be observed.

				<h2>Performance</h2>
				<p>We have used some optimization techniques to make the environment run efficiently, which is important
					for the user experience. The techniques applied to our environment are briefly mentioned.</p>
				<h3>Frustum Culling</h3>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/FrustumCulling.PNG" alt="" /></span>Any camera must
					restrict the scene to a finite space for rendering
					scenes, which prevents it from rendering forever. This is done
					through a technique called frustum culling which clips objects
					outside the view frustum and discards them. Through
					this process, unnecessary computation for objects outside the view
					frustum is removed and results in performance improvements.
				</p>
				<h3>Single Pass Stereo Rendering</h3>
				<p>Multi pass stereo rendering performs the computation to render the same mesh twice
					but treats it as different meshes and issues two draw calls, once for each eye,
					and without optimizations it can take up to double the time rendering compared to a mono display.
					This is inefficient, and single pass rendering uses the same mesh to create one image but issues
					two draw calls to render to each eye, by packing it into a single texture twice the width of one eye
					texture.
					Single pass instanced rendering that we used optimizes this further and reduces the draw of a mesh
					into a
					single draw call that projects twice, once for each eye by instancing each draw call.
					Due to the cache coherency of draw calls, it greatly reduces the CPU use and slightly reduces the
					GPU use,
					resulting in significant performance improvements.
				</p>
				<h3>Level of Detail</h3>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/LODPopping.PNG" alt="" /></span>
					To optimize the environment, we used models that had level of detail that changes with distance.
					Initially the smaller details of the environment had noticeable popping in and out of vision
					due to the short culling distance, and the culling distance of the models that had this issue had to
					be
					scaled individually to be unnoticeable as it distracted the user and broke the sense of immersion.
					The LOD popping, or the sudden appearance of objects from thin air as the distance falls below the
					culling distance, can be seen in the image to the left.
				</p>
				<h3>Textures</h3>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/AlphaBlendedFoliage.PNG" alt="" /></span>
					To create a complex environment with a lot of detail, it is more efficient to use textures instead
					of creating models with every detail that is desired.
					They have been used extensively to create detailed surfaces of objects in the environment, including
					the terrain, trees, mushrooms, rocks, and other plants.

					The trees and plant foliage are implemented as a cloud of textured quadrilaterals which is alpha
					blended
					to make the textures transparent in the foliage to simulate the leaves. This can be seen on the
					left.
				</p>
				<h3>Baked Lights</h3>
				<p>
					Realtime lighting is expensive because all the computation of the lighting of the environment must
					be done at runtime,
					fighting for resources that can be used elsewhere. Therefore, we chose to use a mix of baked
					lighting and realtime lighting
					for the environment to reduce this performance cost at runtime. Baked lights are light information
					for static objects
					that do not move in a scene and are stored in a lightmap which contains the pre-calculated
					brightness of surfaces in the scene.
					This stored information is loaded to light the scene at runtime reducing the rendering cost of
					shadows.
				</p>

				<h2>Performance Evaluation</h2>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Aerial View of Terrain Annotated.PNG" alt="" /></span>The
					environment on which the baseline performance is measured
					has HDR, no SSAO, and no antialiasing. A unity project build has
					been created on which we measure the performance through a
					benchmarking software to measure the fps of the environment. There was no formal
					testing done to measure the latency of the controllers, but heuristic
					evaluation showed that there were no perceptible delays. The protocol for testing involved
					travelling along the boundaries of
					the environment which allows us to get an exposure to the frame rates of the overall
					environment. After starting the environment, we waited for a
					minute before starting to take measurements to discard any frame
					drops from starting the application. Similarly, we discarded frames
					a couple of seconds after beginning the benchmark. We take the
					measurement for a period of 60 seconds in total, and report the
					average fps with its standard deviation, the 1% and the 0.1% fps.
					The 1% and 0.1% fps results indicate the fps at the worst 1% and
					0.1% quantiles of frame rates recorded. This is better than using the
					minimum as the benchmark which can state that we have very low
					minimum fps even if it is for a negligible period which is in most cases undesirable.
				</p>

				<h2>Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
				<p>Three researchers from the University of Cape Town were asked to evaluate the environment.
					Two of them were active researchers in the graphics space, and one was a researcher in psychology.
					The evaluators were overall very happy with the state of the environment and commented that the
					environment had very high realism,
					and no issues with performance in both the display refresh rate and controller latency.
					They experienced no significant cybersickness when viewing the environment and have agreed that the
					environment would certainly be relaxing,
					with the psychology researcher definitively stating that she was relaxed,
					while the computer science researchers stated that they were more focused
					than relaxed to give as much feedback as possible for the evaluation but mentioned it certainly
					would be relaxing.
					They made important points relating to the rendering, usability, and realism which are discussed in
					detail in the <a href="resources/Soo Kyung Ahn NaturePill.pdf">paper</a>.
				</p>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Aerial View of Terrain Annotated.PNG" alt="" /></span>
					We created a realistic, realtime, and restorative environment through meticulous design of the
					environment
					to capture restorative elements of real nature, and the balance of quality and performance.
					The presence and usability of the environment was ensured through research in restorative
					environment design, psychology, and
					various rendering and optimization techniques from computer science.
